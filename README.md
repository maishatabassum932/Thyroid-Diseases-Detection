# Thyroid Disease Recurrence Prediction

This project aims to analyze and build predictive models for recurrence of **well-differentiated thyroid cancer** using clinicopathologic features. The dataset is sourced from the [Thyroid Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/thyroid-disease-data) on Kaggle.

## üìÅ Dataset Information

- Duration: Collected over 15 years
- Follow-up: Each patient tracked for at least 10 years
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (hosted on Kaggle)

#  Objective
I tried to use all the thing that I have learn through my MAchine learning course to build a machine learning model that can **predict the recurrence of thyroid cancer** based on historical clinicopathologic features.
